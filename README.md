# Face Expression Recognition Using CNN

This project aims to develop an advanced face expression recognition system using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to accurately classify human emotions from facial images.

Facial expression recognition is a key step towards natural human-computer interaction. This project utilizes deep learning techniques, specifically CNNs, to classify facial expressions into different categories such as happiness, sadness, surprise, anger, etc.

Features
- Emotion classification from facial images
- Data preprocessing and augmentation
- Model training and evaluation

 Dataset
The project uses the [FER2013](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/msambare/fer2013) dataset, which is a widely used dataset for facial expression recognition. You can download the dataset from Kaggle and place it in the `data` directory.

Model Architecture
The model is built using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) with the following architecture:
- Convolutional layers with ReLU activation
- MaxPooling layers
- Fully connected layers
- Dropout layers for regularization

Training
The model is trained using the following steps:
1. Data collection and preprocessing
2. Data augmentation to increase the diversity of the training set
3. Model design and compilation
4. Model training and validation
